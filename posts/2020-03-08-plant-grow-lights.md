## Photo.... Morpho.. Genesis! 

Everyone has heard of photosynthesis - turning carbon dioxide & water to sugar and oxygen, by way of sunlight. It's how plants survive, store food, and release the oxygen we breath. But have you heard of [photomorphogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomorphogenesis)?

What do we call a plant's growth & development under different sources and intensities of light? Photomorphogenesis. That was a gimme. Two key light receptors that shape a plant's morphogenesis are phytochromes and cryptochromes, which respond to red & far-red light or blue light, respectively. There are also receptors for ultraviolet light & many varieties of all these "photoreceptors". 

What may have you scratching your head is that most of them aren't directly involved in photosynthesis -- they merely optimize the plant's growth. That includes getting the best sun for chloroplasts, but those green bois will get straight to work as soon as sun hits them. They don't need to be told what to do by *no* photoreceptor! If anything, cryptochromes only need to tell chloroplasts when to take a break and avoid "photooxidative damage" - sun burns. 

But let's get our optics straight -- biochemistry is Gabe's job. 

## Wavelengths and Kelvin

The optimum lighting for plants emphasizes ultraviolet, royal blue, red, and far-red light. Different stages of growth favor certain wavelengths, but no seedling will turn away from ultraviolet light -- best for growing full, juicy fruit -- just because its young. Have you ever tried giving candy to a baby? That's even easier than taking it. 

The wavelengths of visible light are in the hundreds of nanometers, but frequently lights are rated by Kelvin or "K". Kelvin measures the "excitation" (or energy level?) of light.
