Ok, we're still under construction here, but at least we have one of those DeWalt jackhammer-proof radios bumping some fresh tunes! Hey, it's better than MySpace blasting Evanescence! 

	Sn- sn- sn- sn-sn-sn-sn-snap that song
	Snap that song, and we're back!
	Look alive, Sunshine
	109 in the sky but the pigs won't quit
	You're here with me, DJ Professor K, baby,
	the master of mayhem, you know what I'm sayin'. 
	Bringing you another autonomous underground Pirate Radio Broadcast from "KRIS Radio!" 
	Transmitted... 
	Packet's coming through? 
	Okay 

That's just one of my remixes, little bit of lyrical genius. Well, it's easy when you're standing on the shoulders of beasts. Check out the [nav pane](nav.md) if you want to know more about what I've been up to. For the upcoming few months it will mainly be coding, game design, gardening, and networking hardware projects.

## The Hacker's Ethics

The idea of a "hacker ethic" is perhaps best formulated in Steven Levy's book, [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution][1]. Levy came up with six tenets:

1. Access to computers - and anything which might teach you omething about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On imperative!

2. All information should be free.

3. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.

4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degress, age, race, or position.

5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.

6. Computers can change your life for the better.
