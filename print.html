title:  Survey of Four Static Site Generators
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>Since the centralized web wants a heavyweight fight, with everything wrapped in hypertext markup, KRIS Radio has to move to a static site generator. Why not write an entry about the tournament we put the contestants through?</p>
<p>This entry has been completely rewritten after realizing how flawed my methods were. I was installing each package and manually counting the changes, attempting to get a configuration, etc. An attempt, but simply examining each package on their manager gives the same information -- faster and without variation due to my local specs.</p>
<p>I used codetab's <a href="https://codetabs.com/count-loc/count-loc-online.html">Count LoC</a> to size up the codebases -- quite convenient as literally every option examined is based on github.</p>
<p>To count dependencies, I just went to each option's package manager, be that rubygems.org, crates.io, or what have you. All told, here's how the numbers shake out:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="right">              </th><th align="center">Ghost </th><th align="center">Jekyll</th><th align="center">Metalsmith</th><th align="center">mdBook</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="right">Lines of Code </td><td align="center">121,792</td><td align="center">41,224 </td><td align="center">4,651      </td><td align="center">16,082 </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Dependencies  </td><td align="center">86    </td><td align="center">12    </td><td align="center">0         </td><td align="center">19 (+6<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>However, this obscures the information about code vulnerabilities in those packages, or sub-dependencies! While doing it the hard way my packaged managed counted almost two hundred vulnerabilities between Ghost and Jekyll, and hundreds more packages installed than advertised as dependencies. Even my selected generator, mdBook, has <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/issues/847">two unlisted security vulnerabilities from fetching Google fonts -- and trackers</a>. (Don't worry, that reference has been removed from dat://krisrad.io!)</p>
<p>So, in the end, mdBook won out due to it's small code base, active developer support (Metalsmith is smaller, but only has one main developer), and the fact that I've been learning rustlang anyways.</p>
<p>Ghost and Jekyll are respectable platforms, but Ghost's paid options seem to be overtaking the free offering to the point where it feels more like a freemium product than FOSS. Jekyll has been fairly inactive for some time. Jekyll does, however, cohabitat with github pages and <code>dat://</code> pretty well.</p>
<p>But more to the point, what is the point of running &quot;open source software&quot; if the code is so thick and overgrown, you close the book as soon as you open it? Now, if mainstream browsers had native support for markdown rendering, this site wouldn't be any thicker than before this entry: a whole 24 lines of code. But we've picked mdBook, and now the only thing to do is dive in headfirst. Until next time!</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>crates.io lists six dependencies of mdBook as &quot;optional&quot;. So the total could be 19 or 25, depending on how you take that. </p>

title:  Refactoring from Jekyll to Dat
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a live walkthrough of refactoring a Jekyll blog into a Dat site. Comparing our site on <code>https://</code> to <code>dat://</code> is quite interesting. I'm currently encoding entries in markdown, which is natively supported by Beaker -- not so much by the major browsers. However, with the site hosted on Github, Hashbase, and my own computer, we will have a strong hand of backups - and mutations - to examine.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We initialize a new Dat in the already-existing git repository. My repositiory was setup as a Jekyll blog, so there's already a few files existing in the folder. We're going to hold onto some of the configuration files and the old <code>/_posts</code> folder, and build a new architecture around them.<br />
<a href="2019-05-22-dir-after-dat-init.PNG">Fig. 001: Directory after Dat init.</a><br />
Creating a new Dat from Beaker Browser's main menu initializes the .datignore files. Compared to a commercial solution, we obviously have a lot of control here. For now, I intend to stay agile while exploring the ecosystem of Dat &amp; Hashbase, and their border with <code>https://</code>. So, I'm keeping the architecture will minimal while I focus on writing new content for the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll left behind a lot of <code>gem</code> and <code>yaml</code> files, so I delete most of them. Some of the data in <code>_config.yml</code> I transfer over to <code>dat.json</code>. Json formatting is more common and standardized than Yaml, but the beautiful thing is I have the freedom to pick either. Unfortunately, editing a <code>dat.json</code> in Beaker's UI deletes all data other than what their UI opens to you (e.g., Name &amp; Description), <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/1409">as I took issue with on Beaker's tracker</a>. For that reason, I highly recommend editing <code>dat.json</code> locally, and dealing with the lack of titles in Beaker.
As for the information I'm including in <code>dat.json</code>, I'm not developing for a specific API, but I have the information that all of them use. It would be pretty easy to interact with sockets on the <code>dat</code> ecosystem that use common fields like title, url, email, twitter_username, and github_username, the handful I saved from jekyll's <code>_config.yaml</code>, and I can easily add more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finished with the initial rollback of jekyll, I had to decide on a static site generator, or try rolling my own. After surveying a few options <a href="2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.html">detailed in my &quot;Survey of Four Static Site Generators&quot; entry</a>, I've decided to roll with <code>mdBook</code>. The short size of the code base was a big factor, plus I'm pretty stoked on rustlang. Check out <a href="2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.html">that entry</a> to see how the Big Bads like Ghost and Jekyll competed with underdogs like Metalsmith and our winner, mdBook!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before we continue our easy-reading experience with mdBook, I'd like to take a moment to remember this site's alien birth, when it couldn't decide which dimension to live in and cried out for stability and comfort.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="2019-05-22-mirrors-https.png">Fig. 002: The frankensite on <code>https://</code></a>.<br />
<a href="2019-05-22-mirrors-dat.png">Fig. 003: Frankensite humanized on <code>dat://</code></a>.<br />
Dat appears much more user-friendly, as Beaker Browser natively renders Markdown. I really wish that was true in major browsers like Firefox, Opera, Chrome, &amp; Explorer - why do we keep all this html metadata around? - as well as on mobile browsers. Not supporting markdown is why I need to pick a static site generator, which is really more hassle than needed, as shown by Dat.</li>
<li>However, it is very interesting to see their mutated attempts. The Hashbase <code>https://</code> mirror only shows the file structure; users can't view files in-browser. Github Pages renders my <code>index.md</code> and <code>nav.md</code> files, which lack any yaml frontmatter - but 404's on my actual posts. Navigating to the raw posts on github.com, however, does show the yaml frontmatter - rendered as a table.</li>
<li>I used a few different protocols here that were not designed with each other in mind. This feels as much like an art experiment as a devlog. Or a breeding lab, feeding radioactive data to different browsers and seeing which can adapt, survive, &amp; thrive. </li>
</ul>
</li>

title:  Game Theory of Everything
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello, worldbuilders!</p>
<p>My name is Kris with a K. This summer I have the opportunity to work with iD Tech as a camp instructor. One of my new responsibilities is designing a curriculum for my campers to follow along with. To make that study plan as accessible as possible, I'll be pushing some entires over the next few weeks about cybersecurity, C++, and Python.</p>
<p>I'm super excited to share what knowledge I can, and learn just as much. One thing I know is that software development is about much more than just coding -- teamwork and project management are obviously huge components, which in turn rest on having well-defined goals, metrics to track the pulse of those goals, and clear communication. So any tutorial, guide, or lesson plan I put up will definitely delve into what we are trying to achieve, why, and the costs and benefits of our chosen approach. Coding is only meaningful in context.</p>
<p>The same can be said of games. Humans have been playing games since we could rub two sticks together; so much is revealed about an individual or society's value's from the games they play. Growing up with one hand on a controller and one in the real world certainly gave me some rather dramatized ideas about right and wrong, what kind of arc my own life would have, and what the world was like. I'm interested in games that resonate closer to real life, and even more, that combine real symbols and reactions in ways only possible through a simulation (because why try to imitate the real world, that does it so much better, when we could do something totally unique?).</p>
<p>For instance, loot mechanics fundamentally disagree with space-time, cramming so many goodies into a single point like we had Mad-Eye Moody's trunk. Many games take this artistic liberty; but how many explore the ways a city's culture does the same geographically? We keep walking cyber-space in the three dimensions. We stay comfortable, replicating real life, rather than using the unique digital experience to contrast it.</p>
<p>Well those are just some general thoughts, and I'll certainly be making some hack-and-slash games like the next guy while I get my footing. Thank you for checking out my blog -- and don't touch that dial. </p>
