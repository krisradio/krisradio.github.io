title:  Survey of Three Static Site Generators
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>The results are in.
Installing <em>Ghost</em> resulted in <code>8,416 changed files with 608,083 additions and 0 deletions</code>. That was one <code>package-lock.json</code> and 8,415 files in <code>node_modules</code>. That's a much tidier, consolidated install than our other two options.</p>
<p>That is, however, in addition to installing <code>ghost-cli</code>. <code>ghost-cli</code> is installed globally. Here's the output from that install. npm only warned me about one deprecation (far less than for Metalsmith):
$ npm install -g ghost-cli@latest</p>
<pre><code>    npm WARN deprecated cross-spawn-async@2.2.5: cross-spawn no longer requires a build toolchain, use it instead
    C:\Users\Sacred Icon\AppData\Roaming\npm\ghost -&gt; C:\Users\Sacred
    Icon\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\ghost-cli\bin\ghost
    + ghost-cli@1.10.1
    added 359 packages from 191 contributors in 115.609s
</code></pre>
<p>Installing <em>Jekyll</em> created <code>9,674 changed files with 1,251,621 additions and 0 deletions</code>. After the basic library, I also had to install <code>gulp-cli</code>, anogolous to ghost-cli above. That gave me another <code>1,090 changed files with 41,289 additions and 293 deletions.</code></p>
<p><code>npm install</code>, meaning we are just installing the jekyll library locally, listed several depracated packages and the distribution of 39 vulnerabilities between them. The final report:</p>
<pre><code>added 893 packages from 462 contributors and audited 10535 packages in 281.321s
found 84 vulnerabilities (39 low, 28 moderate, 17 high)
</code></pre>
<p>( I did not record the console outut for installing <code>gulp-cli</code>. )</p>
<p>Installing <em>Metalsmith</em> resulted in <code>470 changed files with 62,866 additions and 0 deletions</code>, far less. However, Metalsmith had several more config files in the root directory: <code>package.json</code>, <code>package-lock.json</code>, <code>metalsmith.json</code>, and <code>build.js</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[ghost install console output goes here]
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, we had a lot of bits moved around, the numbers on which I'd like to analyze by the metrics of size, reliability, &amp; security. But there are three more important data points: <em>none of them worked out of the box</em>.</p>
<p>I didn't give up as soon as I saw an instruction book, either. Granted, trying to install into a directory already plugged up with files is a losing gambit. I am not weighing out giving any three of these tools another shot.</p>
<p>However, I did spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting. Meanwhile, this <code>.md</code> entry is going up on <code>dat://</code>, <code>2 changed files with 36 additions and 0 deletions</code>.</p>
<p>Ok, after the disappointing performances of <code>Jekyll</code>, <code>Ghost</code>, and <code>Metalsmith</code>, I decided to try the <code>mdbook</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook">rust crate</a>. Rust has been drawing me in for some time; I love the backing of Mozilla, a proven pioneer in the free internet, and the much-bespoke ease of jumping between low-level 'machine code' and high-level 'scripting code' is really exciting.</p>
<p>The install reassured me from jump, with only <code>12 files changed, 1787 insertions(+), 3 deletions</code> for copying the output of <code>mdbook init</code> into my source directory and modifying a couple config files. The first build added another <code>42 changed files with 7,487 additions and 0 deletions</code>. Again, I haven't actually ran these numbers through their statistical ropes, but we can tell from the metrics these projects have very different code bases, and therefore, teams backing them.</p>
<p>Once I fork the <code>mdbook</code> branch this entry should be live..! Let's find out. </p>

title:  Refactoring from Jekyll to Dat
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a live walkthrough of refactoring a Jekyll blog into a Dat site. Comparing our site on <code>https://</code> to <code>dat://</code> is going to be interesting. I'm currently encoding entries in markdown, which is natively supported by Beaker -- not as much by most major browsers. However, with the site hosted on Github, Hashbase, and my own computer, we will have a strong host of backups - and mutations - to examine.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We initialize a new Dat in the already-existing git repository. My repositiory was setup as a Jekyll blog, so there's already a few files existing in the folder. We're going to hold onto some of the configuration files and the old <code>/_posts</code> folder, and build a new architecture around them.<br />
<a href="2019-05-22-dir-after-dat-init.PNG">Fig. 001: Directory after Dat init.</a><br />
Creating a new Dat from Beaker Browser's main menu initializes the .datignore files. Compared to a commercial solution, we obviously have a lot of control here. For now, I intend to stay agile while exploring the ecosystem of Dat, Hashbase, and their border with <code>https://</code>. So, I'm keeping the architecture will minimal while I focus on writing new content for the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll left behind a lot of <code>gem</code> and <code>yaml</code> files, so I delete most of them. Some of the data in <code>_config.yml</code> I transfer over to <code>dat.json</code>. Json formatting is more common and standardized than Yaml -- again, that's not a very scientific judgement -- but the beautiful thing is the level of freedom I have here.<br />
I'm not developing for a specific API, but I have the information that all of them use. It would be pretty easy to write interact with sockets on the <code>dat</code> ecosystem that use common fields like title, url, email, twitter_username, and github_username, the handful I grabbed from <code>_config.yaml</code>, and I can easily add more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That essentially brings this entry up to real time. The next steps are two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate more stable and supported blogging suites. There are many decentralized and open source options to consider. There is also the hands-off stability of contracting professional services. Maintaining a minimal architecture leaves the door open to pivot to either. <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> &amp; <a href="dat://ridder.seed.hex22.org/">Ridder</a> are two interesting options.</li>
<li>Investigate how the site currently appears on Github pages (https), Hashbase.io (https &amp; dat), <em>and</em> my direct Dat address. Initially, they vary in appearance a lot more than what I saw in web development between different mainstream browsers. Hopefully, the functionality is intact across all three, but I can't conclusively say that yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In comparing Jekyll, Ghost, Cryogen, and Metalsmith. In the end I'm picking Metalsmith.<br />
The main benefits with Jekyll were it's extensive integration with Github Pages, which is one of the three current mirrors of my site.<br />
Ghost is well-established and seems to have a really strong team behind it, and good value from their Pro subscriptions.<br />
Cryogen looks to be pretty lightweight, with a similar idealogy as Jekyll and Metalsmith.
Our winner, Metalsmith however, is the simplest; matches the Yaml front matter format I'm currently using; and is based on pure JavaScript, not Ruby, Node.js, or Clojure. The simplicity and bare-metal approach wins out in my analysis, as I really want to keep this blog light and nimble - my focus is my other projects. It's also better-optimized for the p2p web, as bandwidth and processing power is limited for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="2019-05-22-mirrors-https.png">Fig. 002: The site viewed on <code>https://</code></a>.<br />
<a href="2019-05-22-mirros-dat.png">Fig. 003: The site viewed on <code>dat://</code></a>.<br />
Dat appears much more user-friendly, as Beaker Browser natively renders Markdown. I really wish that was true in major browsers like Firefox, Opera, Chrome, &amp; Explorer - why do we keep all this html metadata around? - as well as on mobile browsers. Not supporting markdown is why I need to pick a static site generator, which is really more hassle than needed, as shown by Dat.<br />
However, it is very interesting to see their mutated attempts. The Hashbase <code>https://</code> mirror only shows the file structure; users can't view files in-browser. Github Pages renders my <code>index.md</code> and <code>nav.md</code> files, which lack any yaml frontmatter - but 404's on my actual posts. Navigating to the raw posts on github.com, however, does show the yaml frontmatter - rendered as a table.<br />
I'm using a few different protocols here that were not designed with each other in mind. This feels as much like an art experiment as a devlog. Or a breeding experiment, feeding radioactive data to different browsers and seeing which comes out on top.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing what the next step is, I'll round out this entry on refactoring from Jekyll to pure Dat - really just gutting Jekyll with no alternative - with some thoughts on the p2p web.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there are some interesting ways Dat lacks transparency or privacy. I'm still trying to understand how keys work. One thing is clear, multiwriter support requires integrating other libraries, namely <a href="https://awesome.datproject.org/hyperdrive-multiwriter">Hyperdrive</a>. That means using differnt computers, or even just upgrading to a new one, introduces new dependencies. And dat p2p protocol extension on firefox requires <a href="2019-05-22-firefox-dat-ext-permissions.PNG">extensive permissions (Fig. 004)</a>, introducing security and privacy concerns.</li>
<li>Pushing changes to Beaker removes some of the json data I added to <code>dat.json</code>. That's not surprising, but it still crosses my sense of independence. I'm sure I'll have to swallow more changes in refactoring to Metalsmith.</li>
<li>However, it is supremely easy to get up and running with <code>dat://</code>! Anyone in the world could access and download this entire website. I have a constellation of backups and mirrors that took no money, and almost no time, to spin up. It's much more user-friendly than my experiences with BitTorrent and Tor. I'm quite excited to continue the experiment!</li>
</ul>

title:  Game Theory of Everything
date:   2019-05-20 10:00:00 -0800</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello, worldbuilders!</p>
<p>My name is Kris with a K. This summer I have the opportunity to work with iD Tech as a camp instructor. One of my new responsibilities is designing a curriculum for my campers to follow along with. To make that study plan as accessible as possible, I'll be pushing some entires over the next few weeks about cybersecurity, C++, and Python.</p>
<p>I'm super excited to share what knowledge I can, and learn just as much. One thing I know is that software development is about much more than just coding -- teamwork and project management are obviously huge components, which in turn rest on having well-defined goals, metrics to track the pulse of those goals, and clear communication. So any tutorial, guide, or lesson plan I put up will definitely delve into what we are trying to achieve, why, and the costs and benefits of our chosen approach. Coding is only meaningful in context.</p>
<p>The same can be said of games. Humans have been playing games since we could rub two sticks together; so much is revealed about an individual or society's value's from the games they play. Growing up with one hand on a controller and one in the real world certainly gave me some rather dramatized ideas about right and wrong, what kind of arc my own life would have, and what the world was like. I'm interested in games that resonate closer to real life, and even more, that combine real symbols and reactions in ways only possible through a simulation (because why try to imitate the real world, that does it so much better, when we could do something totally unique?).</p>
<p>For instance, loot mechanics fundamentally disagree with space-time, cramming so many goodies into a single point like we had Mad-Eye Moody's trunk. Many games take this artistic liberty; but how many explore the ways a city's culture does the same geographically? We keep walking cyber-space in the three dimensions. We stay comfortable, replicating real life, rather than using the unique digital experience to contrast it.</p>
<p>Well those are just some general thoughts, and I'll certainly be making some hack-and-slash games like the next guy while I get my footing. Thank you for checking out my blog -- and don't touch that dial. </p>
