  <h1 class="post-title">Refactoring from Jekyll to Dat</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2019-05-22</span>
  <p>This is a live walkthrough of refactoring a Jekyll blog into a Dat site. Comparing our site on <code>https://</code> to <code>dat://</code> is quite interesting. I'm currently encoding entries in markdown, which is natively supported by Beaker -- not so much by the major browsers. However, with the site hosted on Github, Hashbase, and my own computer, we will have a strong hand of backups - and mutations - to examine. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We initialize a new Dat in the already-existing git repository. My repositiory was setup as a Jekyll blog, so there's already a few files existing in the folder. We're going to hold onto some of the configuration files and the old <code>/_posts</code> folder, and build a new architecture around them.<br />
<a href="https://krisrad.io/engd/web/dat-jekyll-refactor/2019-05-22-dir-after-dat-init.PNG">Fig. 001: Directory after Dat init.</a><br />
Creating a new Dat from Beaker Browser's main menu initializes the .datignore files. Compared to a commercial solution, we obviously have a lot of control here. For now, I intend to stay agile while exploring the ecosystem of Dat &amp; Hashbase, and their border with <code>https://</code>. So, I'm keeping the architecture will minimal while I focus on writing new content for the site. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll left behind a lot of <code>gem</code> and <code>yaml</code> files, so I delete most of them. Some of the data in <code>_config.yml</code> I transfer over to <code>dat.json</code>. Json formatting is more common and standardized than Yaml, but the beautiful thing is I have the freedom to pick either. Unfortunately, editing a <code>dat.json</code> in Beaker's UI deletes all data other than what their UI opens to you (e.g., Name &amp; Description), <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/1409">as I took issue with on Beaker's tracker</a>. For that reason, I highly recommend editing <code>dat.json</code> locally, and dealing with the lack of titles in Beaker. 
As for the information I'm including in <code>dat.json</code>, I'm not developing for a specific API, but I have the information that all of them use. It would be pretty easy to interact with sockets on the <code>dat</code> ecosystem that use common fields like title, url, email, twitter_username, and github_username, the handful I saved from jekyll's <code>_config.yaml</code>, and I can easily add more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finished with the initial rollback of jekyll, I had to decide on a static site generator, or try rolling my own. After surveying a few options <a href="https://krisrad.io/engd/web/dat-jekyll-refactor/2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.html">detailed in my &quot;Survey of Four Static Site Generators&quot; entry</a>, I've decided to roll with <code>mdBook</code>. The short size of the code base was a big factor, plus I'm pretty stoked on rustlang. Check out <a href="https://krisrad.io/engd/web/dat-jekyll-refactor/2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.html">that entry</a> to see how the Big Bads like Ghost and Jekyll competed with underdogs like Metalsmith and our winner, mdBook! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before we continue our easy-reading experience with mdBook, I'd like to take a moment to remember this site's alien birth, when it couldn't decide which dimension to live in and cried out for stability and comfort. </p>

Dat appears much more user-friendly, as Beaker Browser natively renders Markdown. I really wish that was true in major browsers like Firefox, Opera, Chrome, &amp; Explorer - why do we keep all this html metadata around? - as well as on mobile browsers. Not supporting markdown is why I need to pick a static site generator, which is really more hassle than needed, as shown by Dat.</li>
<li>However, it is very interesting to see their mutated attempts. The Hashbase <code>https://</code> mirror only shows the file structure; users can't view files in-browser. Github Pages renders my <code>index.md</code> and <code>nav.md</code> files, which lack any yaml frontmatter - but 404's on my actual posts. Navigating to the raw posts on github.com, however, does show the yaml frontmatter - rendered as a table.</li>
<li>I used a few different protocols here that were not designed with each other in mind. This feels as much like an art experiment as a devlog. Or a breeding lab, feeding radioactive data to different browsers and seeing which can adapt, survive, &amp; thrive. </li>
