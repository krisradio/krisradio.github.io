Verilog is a Hardware Description Language. Despite how similar it looks to C and other object-oriented languages, it can throttle code execution with real-time nanosecond delays -- and equally, execute many lines of code at once! 

Why the seeming contradiction? Because the code you execute in a Verilog IDE, through simulation and analysis, is just a stepping stone to the "*Hardware Description*" part of verilog: synthesizing code that can be deployed or manufactured on *hardware*. Verilog allows us to write in a familiar style not for a general-purpose OS running on an x86 or x64 CPU, but embedded microcontrollers. 

We are mindful that asynchronous execution is particularly powerful with paired with multiple sensitivity lists to the same inputs. For instance, the following two always blocks would respond in sync to a change of the most significant control signals, `CLK` & `arst_l`:

    always @(posedge CLK, posedge arst_l) 
    begin 
        \\ nonblocking sequential logic 
    end 
    
    always @(posedge CLK, posedge arst_l)
    begin 
        \\ nonblocking sequential logic 
    end
