### Mesh Networks
#### [Host a p2p site on your computer](@/engd/2020-03-19-host-p2p-site-on-dat.md)  
With Dat, you can host a website on your own computer -- a website served worldwide from a swarm of *seeders* who think your content worth sharing.

### Web Development

#### [Survey of four static site generators](@/engd/2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.md)  
Why write static HTML when a site generator can wrap your content up with a bow on top? I'll walk you through two big name options, Ghost and Jekyll, plus several smaller players -- Metalsmith, mdBook, and Zola. You pick the best generator for your static site. 

#### [Refactoring from Jekyll to Dat](@/engd/2019-05-22-dat-jekyll-refactor.md)

See the [survey of static site generators](@/engd/2019-05-30-four-static-site-generators.md) for a more detailed, technical breakdown.
