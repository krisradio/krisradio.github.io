The premsie of a Linear Time-Invariant System is that *any* linear combination of input equations with *any* time shifts can be mapped to valid output equations in a given LTI System. This rule is called "<em>Superposition</em>". According to [dspguide.com](https://www.dspguide.com/ch5/6.htm), superposition is the "basis of nearly all signal processing techniques". 

Besides the utility of chopping up, scaling, and translating signal blocks, superposition is a powerful idea that asks us to break complex problems down into manageable pieces. 

## Linearity 
Call this the input/output mapping of a system: 

\\[x(t) \Rightarrow y(t)\\]

We identify two specific input/output pairs: 

\\[x_1(t) \Rightarrow y_1(t)\\]
\\[x_2(t) \Rightarrow y_2(t)\\]

If the system is Linear, we can add linear combinations of the input x(t) functions together to composite a valid output y(t): 

\\[x_3(t) = ax_1(t) + bx_2(t) \Rightarrow y_3(t) = ay_1(t) + by_2(t)\\]

The output mapped by x<sub>3</sub>(t) exactly equals the <em>addition</em> of the outputs mapped by ax<sub>1</sub>(t) and bx<sub>2</sub>(t). That a linear system's premise. We can show the same result using matrix algebra. Here we add the mapped outputs of the two discrete functions together: 

\\[\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} [x(t)] + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ b \end{bmatrix} [x(t)] \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} ay(t) \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ by(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} ay(t) \\\\ by(t) \end{bmatrix}\\]

While here, we create a composite input of two x(t) functions, with coefficients a and b, mapping the composite function input to the exact same output matrix:

\\[\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \end{bmatrix} [x(t)] \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} ax(t) \\\\ bx(t) \end{bmatrix}\\]

Linear combination of inputs mapping to the exact same single output as the linear combination of outputs from discrete inputs is the condition of a linear system. 

### Linearity Test
The five steps to prove that a system is linear follow from the condition above: 

1. Map the first input-output pair:  
x<sub>1</sub>(t) ⇒ y<sub>1</sub>(t)
1. Map the second input-output pair:  
x<sub>2</sub>(t) ⇒ y<sub>2</sub>(t)
3. Create a linear-combination <em>input</em> and map its output:  
x<sub>3</sub>(t) = ax<sub>1</sub>(t) + bx<sub>2</sub>(t) ⇒ y<sub>3</sub>(t)
4. Find the linear-combination <em>output</em> a linear system would have:  
y<sub>L</sub>(t) = ay<sub>1</sub>(t) + by<sub>2</sub>(t)
5. The system is linear if the outputs match:  
y<sub>3</sub>(t) ?= y<sub>L</sub>(t)

## Time Invariance 
Taking the same fundamental input/output mapping: 

\\[x(t) \Rightarrow y(t)\\]

We identify a specific input/output pair at another point in time: 

\\[x_1(t-T) \Rightarrow y_1(t-T)\\]

If the system is Time Invariant, the time-shifted input x<sub>1</sub>(t) maps to the same specific y(t) function, y<sub>1</sub>(t), as you'd find by time-shifting the system's mapped output.

### Time Invariance Test 
The four steps to prove a system's time invariance follow from the above condition: 

1. Map the systems general input-output pairing:  
x(t) = y(t)
2. Define a time-shifted input and its paired output:  
x<sub>1</sub>(t) = x(t-T) ⇒ y<sub>1</sub>(t) = y(t-T)
3. Find the time-shifted output a TI system <em>would</em> have:  
y<sub>TI</sub>(t) = y(t-T)
4. The system is time invariant if the outputs match:  
y<sub>1</sub>(t) ?= y<sub>TI</sub>(t)

# Properties of LTI Systems 
One very important property is that integrating and deriving the input of an LTI system propagates to the output: 

\\[\because x(t) \Rightarrow y(t),\\]
\\[\therefore \frac{dx}{dt} \Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dt}\\]
\\[\therefore \int_{-\inf}^tx(\tau)d\tau \Rightarrow \int_{-\inf}^ty(\tau)d\tau\\]

This follow-through becomes very useful when we consider that fundamental properites of current and voltage are related by derivation in capacitors and inductors, and one elementary DSP function, the [unit step](/engd/dsp/elem-func#unit-step), is the derivative of the [unit impulse](/engd/dsp/elem-func#unit-impulse). In fact, the latter case is so useful that the LTI responses to unit-impulse and unit-step have their own names and notation: 

\\[x(t) = \delta(t) \Rightarrow y(t) = h(t) \\ x(t) = u(t) \Rightarrow y(t) = g(t)\\]

The impulse response is called h(t), while the step response is called g(t). Because of the step-unit relationship, and the fact that derivatives and integrations carry through, the impulse response h(t) is the derivative of the step response g(t).

\\[h(t) = \frac{dg(t)}{dt} \\ g(t) = \int_{-\inf}^t h(\tau) d\tau\\]
